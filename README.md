## Abstract
Historically, mapping and surveying deep sea environments has been difficult due to the resources required. By utilizing innovations in deep learning techniques, we can save on both equipment and time by generating de-artifacted and colorized images, as opposed to upgrading camera equipment or using traditional image editing methods. By further leveraging this technology, we can generate real-time photography and potentially video of marine life, underwater structures, coral reefs, sea floor mapping, and much more.
